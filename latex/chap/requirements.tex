\section{Driving technical requirements}

The pipeline shall take satellite images as an input. In this project, the data from Sentinel-1 \gls{ESA} satellite is used. The algorithm for ship detection on these images shall be developed and implemented. To check the accuracy of the algorithm, AIS data should be used. Results shall be visualized and plotted on a geographic map. The output of the pipeline shall be presented as a dataset, which contains the images of the detected ships by the developed algorithm with corresponding information from \gls{AIS}. The output of the pipeline may be used on the next stages of the project as a training dataset for machine learning algorithms.
