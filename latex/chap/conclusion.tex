\section{Conclusion}

In this project, the simple algorithm for ship detection as well as the satellite images preprocessing were implemented. The result seems to be promising, however, the considered \gls{AIS} data source was incomplete and it was not possible to check the accuracy of the algorithm. So, further research of the available \gls{AIS} data sources is needed for getting “ship/no ship” labels of the detected objects and building a training dataset.
