\section{Introduction}

Nowadays, satellite images are becoming more available and this data can be very useful for businesses and governments. At the same time, the development of artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning, makes it possible to use this space data effectively for different applications. 

One of the promising applications of machine learning on satellite images is ship detection task, because this can be used by government, for example, to prevent illegal fishing or immigration. The goal of this project is to automatize the ship detection on satellite images by development and implementation of the special data processing pipeline.
