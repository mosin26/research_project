\section{Conclusion}




The proposed two-steps approach for ships detection on river waters in this project improves the results of the original \gls{cfar} algorithm. In particular, it can be used effectively for removing a large number of false positive detections from the observation. Experiment done in this work on the area of the Volga river showed that the approach is reasonable, but still requires further improvements. Collecting more relevant raining data for \gls{cnn} can be considered as one of the first future steps for this project.
